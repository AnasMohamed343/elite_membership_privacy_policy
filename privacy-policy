Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, we provide this privacy policy notice explaining the way your personal information is collected and used.

Collection of Routine Information

This app tracks basic information about its users. This includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, device details, timestamps, and referring screens. None of this information can personally identify a specific user. The information is tracked for routine administration and app optimization purposes.

Information We Collect

We may collect the following types of information:

Personal Information:

Full name

Contact details (email, phone number)

Address

Job title

Payment-related information (handled securely via Stripe)

Mobile number (optional at account creation, required before initiating a membership purchase)
Why the Mobile number is required before initiating a membership purchase (for transaction verification or communication).

App Usage Data:

User interaction with app features, including provider views and region selections

Device Information:

Use of Google Maps API

The app uses the Google Maps API to display the location of healthcare providers (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, labs, radiology centers, and optical clinics) based on the user’s selected region (Egypt or UAE). Location access is only used for showing providers location within the selected region and is not stored or tracked.

Phone Numbers of Healthcare Providers

Our app includes clickable phone numbers for healthcare providers. When users tap these numbers, they are redirected to their device’s dialer to initiate a call. We do not record or monitor these calls.

How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:

Provide and manage digital membership card functionality

Help users locate and connect with participating healthcare providers

Facilitate secure payments for the membership card through Stripe

Display relevant discounts and provider details based on region

Communicate important updates or support-related information

Improve app performance and user experience

Information Sharing

We may share user information with:

Healthcare partners to verify valid membership status and offer discounts

Stripe for payment processing (subject to their own privacy and security standards)

We will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties.

Cookies

Where necessary, this app may use cookies or local storage to improve user experience, store preferences, and enable certain features. You can manage or disable cookies via your device settings.

Advertisement and Third Parties

We currently do not serve third-party advertisements within this app. If this changes, the privacy policy will be updated accordingly, and users will be informed in advance.

Links to Third-Party Services

Our app may link to third-party websites or services (e.g., Stripe for payment processing, Google Maps for provider directions). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. Please review their policies separately.

We no longer use Firebase Analytics.

Security

We use industry-standard security practices to:

Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., during Stripe payment transactions)

Prevent unauthorized access to stored data

Monitor and update our systems regularly for potential vulnerabilities

However, no digital transmission or storage method can be guaranteed 100% secure.
